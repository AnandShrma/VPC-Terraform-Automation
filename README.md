# VPC Creation with Terraform & GitHub Actions Automation 
**Introduction**

In modern cloud infrastructure, automating the provisioning of resources is crucial for efficiency and consistency. This project demonstrates how to leverage Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool, in conjunction with GitHub Actions, a CI/CD platform, to automate the creation and management of Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) on cloud platforms

**Prerequisites**
Before embarking on this project, ensure you have the following:

Terraform: Installed on your local machine.
GitHub Account: Access to create repositories and configure actions.
Cloud Provider Account: Credentials for the cloud service where the VPC will be deployed (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
```bash
project-root/
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── terraform.yml

- main.tf: Contains the primary Terraform configuration for the VPC.
- variables.tf: Defines input variables for the Terraform configuration.
- outputs.tf: Specifies the outputs of the Terraform deployment.
- github/workflows/terraform.yml: Houses the GitHub Actions workflow configuration.
